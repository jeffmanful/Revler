Use of technologies to collect information. We use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities on our Service.
Information collected automatically. We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit our Service. This information could include your IP address, device ID and type, your browser type and language, the operating system used by your device, access times, your mobile device’s geographic location while our application is actively running, and the referring website address.
Cookies and use of cookie and similar data. When you visit our Service, we may assign your device one or more cookies or other technologies that facilitate personalization to facilitate access to our Service and to personalize your experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your activity on our Service, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your visits and the links you click.

            Pixel tags. We embed pixel tags (also called web
beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services. Ad companies also use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).
Mobile device IDs. If you're using our app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our app. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted, but Advertising IDs can be reset in “Settings” on your iPhone. Ad companies also use device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.

We do not provide any non- masked or non-obscured personal information to third parties. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org).

Aggregated and/or non-personal information. We may use and share non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with other third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Service and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see.

            Do Not Track disclosure
            Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide the opt- out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals, as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
Third-party websites
There are a number of places on our Service where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our Service, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third- party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the “privacy” link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

            Data retention
We keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable legal requirements. If you close your account, we will retain certain data for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Service or our

Your choices about collection and use of your information

but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Service because such information may be required in order for you to register as user; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions.
Our Service may also deliver notifications to your phone or mobile device. You can disable these notifications by going into “App Settings” on the app or by changing the settings on your mobile device.

            How we protect your personal information
We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other
            communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/ bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
You agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues, such as security breaches. We may post a notice on our Service if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us.
Information you provide about yourself while using our Service
We provide areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.

            In App Purchases. From time to time, Revler may offer products and services for purchase (“in app purchases”) through iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by Revler (each, a “Software Store”). If you choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with your Software Store (“your IAP Account”), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in app purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for in app purchases that apply to your IAP Account. Some Software Stores may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you purchase an auto- recurring periodic subscription through an in app purchase, your IAP Account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your IAP account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise
            deleted your account with us or the Revler application from your device.

In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer.

JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.

          <h5>Safety Tips</h5>
          <h2>Dating Safely</h2>
          <p className="carousel-text">
Revler brings people together. With more than 20 billion matches made to date and millions of new matches made daily, our community is constantly growing.
With so many people on Revler, user safety is a priority. We understand that meeting someone for the first time whether online, through an acquaintance or on an outing is intriguing and exciting. However, your safety is very important, and because you are in control of your Revler experience, there are certain safety steps that you should follow while dating – both online and offline.
We ask you to read the tips and information below, and strongly urge you to follow these guidelines in the interest of your personal safety and well-being. However, you are always the best judge of your own safety, and these guidelines are not intended to be a substitute for your own judgment.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="slide-box">
          <h2>Online Behavior</h2>
          <p className="carousel-text">
            <strong>Protect Your Finances & Never Send Money or Financial Information</strong>
            Never respond to any request to send money, especially overseas or via wire transfer, and report it to us immediately – even if the person claims to be in an emergency. Wiring money is like sending cash: the sender
has no protections against loss and it’s nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace the money. For more information, click on the video below to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's advice to avoid online dating scams, also available here.
<br/>
<strong>Protect Your Personal Information</strong> <br/>
Never give personal information, such as: your social security number, credit card number or bank information, or your work or home address to people you don’t know or haven’t met in person.
Note: Revler will never send you an email asking for your username and password information. Any such communication should be reported immediately.
<br/>
<strong>Be Web Wise</strong> <br/>
Block and report suspicious users. You can block and report concerns about any suspicious user anonymously at any time on Revler – while swiping or after you’ve matched. Keep conversations on the platform. Bad actors will try to move the conversation to text, personal email or phone conversations.
<br/>
<strong>Report All Suspicious Behavior</strong>
Additionally, please report anyone who violates our terms of use.
Examples of terms of use violations include: <br/>
<ul className="carousel-text">
  <li>Asks you for money or donations</li>
  <li>Requesting photographs.</li>
  <li>Minors using the platform</li>
  <li>Users sending harassing or offensive messages</li>
  <li>Users behaving inappropriately after meeting in person</li>
  <li>Fraudulent registration or profiles.</li>
  <li>Spam or solicitation, such as invitations to call 1-900
numbers or attempts to sell products or services.</li>
</ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="slide-box">
          <h2>Offline Behavior </h2>
          <p className="carousel-text">
            First meetings are exciting, but always take precautions and follow these guidelines to help you stay safe:
            <br/>
            <strong>Get to Know the Other Person</strong>
            Keep your communications limited to the platform and really get to know users online/using the app before meeting them in person. Bad actors often push people to communicate off the platform immediately. It’s up to you to research and do your due diligence.
            <br/>
            <strong>Always Meet and Stay in Public</strong>
            <br/>
Meet for the first time in a populated, public place – never in a private or remote location, and never at your home or apartment. If your date pressures you, end the date and leave at once.
            <br/>
            <strong>Tell Your Friends and Family Members of Your Plans</strong>
            <br/>
Inform a friend or family member of your plans and when and where you’re going. Make sure you have your cell phone charged and with you at all times.

            <br/>
            <strong>Transport Yourself to and from the Meeting</strong>
            <br/>
You need to be independent and in control of your own transportation, especially in case things don’t work out.
            <br/>
            <strong>Stay Sober</strong>
            <br/>
            Consumption of alcohol and/or other drugs can impair your judgment and potentially put you in danger. It’s important to keep a clear mind and avoid anything that might place you at risk. Be aware that bad actors might try to take advantage of you by altering your beverage(s) with synthetic substances.

            Revler welcomes everyone and empowers our community of users to create and cultivate relationships. An important aspect of any healthy relationship though – whether formed on Revler or otherwise – is ensuring proper sexual health and safety. And as a member of the Revler community it is your responsibility to make sure you do the following, if you choose to engage in sexual activity. Protect Yourself.
You and your partner should use proper protection. Condoms and other mechanisms can significantly reduce the risk of contracting or passing on an STI, such as HIV. To be effective, however, protective measures must be used consistently. Please keep in mind, you can still get certain STIs, like herpes or HPV from contact with your partner’s skin even when using a condom.
Be Open and Honest
It is completely reasonable to have a conversation with your partner regarding sex and sexual contact before actually having it. All issues ranging from the number of partners each of you has had, to the last time each of you was tested for STIs are fair game. Many STIs are curable
or treatable. If either you or your partner has an STI that is curable, you both need to start treatment to avoid becoming re-infected. It is important to be completely honest in these conversations.
Vaccinate
The risk of contracting some STIs can be reduced through vaccination. Talk to your doctor or a professional at a sexual health clinic to learn more.
Know Your Status
Know your status. Some STIs don't show symptoms. Regular testing is critical to staying on top of your health and helping prevent the spread of STIs. After testing, always ask for a copy of your test results so you are sure of your status. There are many free, quick and confidential testing options - find the best locations near you using Healthvana's free HIV and STD testing locator.
